          Question:
            You are given a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [birthi, deathi] indicates the
            birth and death years of the ith person.

            The population of some year x is the number of people alive during that year.
            The ith person is counted in year x's population if x is in the inclusive range [birthi, deathi - 1].
            Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.
            Return the earliest year with the maximum population.



        Example 1:
        Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
        Output: 1993
        Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.
